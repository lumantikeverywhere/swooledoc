When I started learning swoole at https://www.swoole.com and http://swoole.co.uk/docs/, I did not think I was able to start anything yet. I'm expecting a php application example that usually starts from index.php from which I can trace and understand the outline of the php programming structure in the swoole environment.

Well, apparently, the swoole docs are made for advanced developers, which are very advanced. I've been working with PHP for about 10 years, but it's still hard to get started.

So after reading the documentation I mentioned above, I spent almost a week building structures from everything I knew into php programming structures that fit my programming style (hopefully it suits you too), so I can focus on the logic I need for my project.
